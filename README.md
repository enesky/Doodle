# Doodle

Just doodling around

Trying to apply best practices for later usages :)


## How to run the app

In order to run the app, you need to create a `local.properties` file in the root folder of the project.  
Here is how my current `local.properties` looks like:

```
sdk.dir=/Users/eky/Library/Android/sdk

doodle.api.url="https://api.jikan.moe/v4/"
doodle.api.key="sample api key" #Jikan API doesn't require an API key, but I'm using it as an example
```
