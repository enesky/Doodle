/**
 * The best option for using one time events with Compose is using Channels.
 * When using states we need to make sure we reset the state after the event is consumed.
 * So it can be forgotten and not re-triggered.
 * When using shared flow it can't re-trigger the event and it can cause to step backs.
 * So in order to fix it we need to add replay cache to the shared flow. But it can cause memory leaks.
 * So directly using channels is the best option.
 *
 * How to use ObserveAsEvents:
 * Create a channel on ViewModel and expose it as a flow.
 * on ViewModel:
 * private val navigationChannel = Channel<NavigationEvent>()
 * val navigationEventsChannelFlow = navigationChannel.receiveAsFlow()
 *
 * viewModelScope.launch {
 *    navigationChannel.send(NavigationEvent.To(route = "route"))
 * }
 *
 * on Composable:
 * ObserveAsEvents(viewModel.navigationEventsChannelFlow) { event ->
 *     when (event) {
 *         is NavigationEvent.To -> {
 *             navController.navigate(event.route)
 *         }
 *     }
 * }
 *
 * check: https://youtu.be/njchj9d_Lf8 for more info
 *
 * @param flow The flow to observe as events
 * @param onEvent The event callback
